# Deploying & Managing a Quarkus Application on Red Hat OpenShift

Hands-on experience using the free Red Hat Developer Sandbox (OpenShift 4.20).

## What I Did
- Deployed a sample Quarkus app via the console catalog.
- Added readiness/liveness health checks to ensure stability.
- Exposed the app publicly with a Route.
- Manually scaled replicas from 1 → 3 to demonstrate horizontal scaling and self-healing.
- Triggered a new source-to-image build and verified rolling update across all pods.
- Monitored via the Observe tab.
