# Openshift Portfolio

Hands-on projects using Red Hat Openshift in the Red Hat Developer Sandbox available here: https://sandbox.redhat.com/

Red Hat OpenShift is an enterprise-grade container orchestration platform built on Kubernetes, providing a complete, supported solution for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

It extends vanilla Kubernetes with built-in tools for developers (CI/CD pipelines, web console), enhanced security, monitoring, logging, service mesh, and consistent operation across hybrid cloud environments (on-premises, public clouds like AWS/Azure/GCP).

OpenShift makes Kubernetes production-ready and easier to use for large organizations, while remaining compatible with standard Kubernetes APIs and workloads, and adding additional OpenShift APIs and capabilities.
